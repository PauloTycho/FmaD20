Alchemist Player Class Handbook

Introduction
	The Alchemist Player class is the starting point for any player looking to play a caster of some type. For prestige classes like Healer, Flame Alchemist etc.. Some amount of base alchemical knowledge will be required before delving into a specialty, although when initially building a character the player should keep in mind future requirements for the desired specialty.

Class Features
	These are the class features granted to all alchemists at each appropriate level.
The Law of Equivalent Exchange
	The first rule that every fledgling alchemist becomes fluent in is the Law of Equivalent exchange. This means that matter cannot be created unless adequate energy is supplied, and the same in the opposite. 1kg of rock cannot become 2kg of rock, and life can only be created from life. 
Personal Transmutation Circle
	Upon beginning training as an alchemist, either under a tutor or through personal research, an alchemist must create or adapt a personal transmutation circle which becomes the foundation of their alchemy. This is the first step to becoming a full fledged alchemist.

	Transmutations
	Once a player becomes an alchemist, they gain access to specific transmutations outside of the general alchemical principles, check the transmutations table for specifics. 


	Alchemical Comprehension 
	Alchemists due to their research into transmutation have an understanding of the materials that make up the material world, this is fundamental to their craft, since it is necessary to understand the composition of an object before changing its form. When encountering a new material, they may add a +4 bonus to a knowledge check, and do not have to make a check for materials they have encountered previously to transmute them into a new form.

	Alchemical Deconstruction
At 2nd Level through study an alchemist begins to understand the process of destroying an object to use its material, once the object has been broken down it’s material may be remade into something different, these are often crude objects such as spears or large objects, since complexity of machines are lost in the destruction.

While not in a time sensitive situation and as long as the  it does not violate the rules of equivalent exchange, an alchemist may make consecutive concentration checks to us destructive alchemy until the result is achieved, check destructive/reconstructive alchemy check table. While in combat or in an otherwise time sensitive situation, add +5 to deconstruction checks. 

Alchemical Reconstruction
At 3rd Level an alchemist comes to understand the principle of reconstruction, where by using the flow of energy an object can be remade or repaired, instead of breaking down an object, the current composition can be modified. 

While not in a time sensitive situation and as long as the  it does not violate the rules of equivalent exchange, an alchemist may make consecutive concentration checks to use reconstructive alchemy until the result is achieved, check destructive alchemy/reconstructive check table. While in combat or in an otherwise time sensitive situation, add +5 to reconstruction checks.
